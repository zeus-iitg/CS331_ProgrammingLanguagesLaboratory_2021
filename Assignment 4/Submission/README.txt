Instructions for Running the Code
---------------------------------

For Linux:
1. Make sure GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler for Haskell) is installed on your machine.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing the source code.
3. For compilation, type 'ghc 180101086.hs' and press enter. 
4. To run the file, type './180101086' and press enter.
5. You will be prompted to enter an input.
6. Provide a valid input (a comma-separated list of Integers (with or without square brackets),
   e.g [12,2,4,5,18] or 12,2,4,5,18) and then press enter.
7. The various outputs (parsed list, LCM and BST traversals) will be displayed on the screen.

For Windows:
1. Make sure GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler for Haskell) is installed on your machine.
2. Open the command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the source code.
3. For compilation, type 'ghc .\180101086.hs' and press enter. 
4. To run the file, type '.\180101086.exe' and press enter.
5. You will be prompted to enter an input.
6. Provide a valid input (a comma-separated list of Integers (with or without square brackets),
   e.g [12,2,4,5,18] or 12,2,4,5,18) and then press enter.
7. The various outputs (parsed list, LCM and BST traversals) will be displayed on the screen.
